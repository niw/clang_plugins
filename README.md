Clang plugins
=============

This is a repository for Clang plugins examples and development, that works alongside Xcode.

You can implement your own Clang plugins to extend your day-to-day Xcode workflow,
like custom analyzer checker to warn cording rules or source-to-source converter for refactoring.

Contents
--------

### `xcode_toolchain`

This directory contains CMake scripts that build custom Xcode toolchain from Appleâ€™s Swift source tree.
See `xcode_toolchain/README.md` for the details.

### `examples`

This directory contains Clang tool, plugin and analyzer checker examples and Xcode project
that is using these plugin and analyzer checker.
See `examples/README.md` for the details.

Usage
-----

There are two steps to use this project.

### Create a custom Xcode toolchain

First, build your own custom Xcode toolchain that includes the LLVM and Clang libraries we need.
This step takes long time.

    $ brew install cmake ninja
    $ cd xcode_toolchain
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -G Ninja ../
    $ cmake --build . --target apple_llvm-symlink_xcode_toolchain

See `xcode_toolchains/README.md` for the details.

### Build the project with examples.

Then, build the project, including examples.

    $ cd ..
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCLANG_PLUGINS_XCODE_TOOLCHAIN=Custom ../
    $ cmake --build .

It creates all example plugins. Open `examples/Example.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build the example project
or analyze it to see how each plugin or analyzer checker works.

### Use IDE

This project also can be imported and build in various IDE that supports CMake.
Stil, you first need to build the Xcode toolchain as described above.

You can use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) to import this project.
Set `-DCLANG_PLUGINS_XCODE_TOOLCHAIN=Custom` at CMake options in CMake pane of Build, Execution,
Deployment section in the project preferences.

You can also use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with
[CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vector-of-bool.cmake-tools) extension.

Set next workspace settings in `.vscode/settings.json` with next configuration.

    {
        "cmake.configureSettings": {
            "CLANG_PLUGINS_XCODE_TOOLCHAIN": "Custom"
        }
    }

CMake Tools may [configure Intelli Sence](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/07/25/visual-studio-code-cc-extension-july-2018-update-and-intellisense-auto-configuration-for-cmake/)
once it completes CMake configuration.

### CMake variables

* `CLANG_PLUGINS_XCODE_TOOLCHAIN`

    Name of Xcode toolchain that is used for building these example Clang tool,
    plugin, or analyzer checker.
    Default to environment variable `TOOLCHAINS` as like how `xcrun` works.

There are a few extra CMake variables for examples.
See `examples/README.md` for the details.
